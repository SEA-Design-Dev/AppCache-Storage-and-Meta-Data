+###A project for Code Fellows B25 by Henok Kidane and Shane Kalles
+
+Our build of AppCache-Storage-and-Meta-Data.
+
+We wanted to make a page the displayed differently based on whether the user was online/offline by making use of the AppCache. Learning that we needed a pythin server up and running to make the Appcache work was a bit of a delay in getting the functionality to work.
+
+We also included local storage as part of a basic form. We were able to locate a few different online examples to work from, including a jQuery example that we used to help create our JaveScript.
+
+The imageAPI section was not copied and pasted but rather we typed each line slowly to better understand each line of code as we went.
