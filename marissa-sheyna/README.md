#AppCache, Storage and FileReader API
###A project for Code Fellows B25 by Marissa Felitto and Sheyna Watkins

We started trying to use the IndexedED Todo list however we couldn't get it to work on the same page as the File Read. So we switched to Local Storage.

Marissa took charge of the CSS and Sheyna managed the integration with JavaScript.

Resources:
* Code Adapted from [Dave Winer's Local Storage](http://scripting.com/misc/localStorageDemo.html)
* [File Reader](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/reading-files-using-the-html5-filereader-api)
